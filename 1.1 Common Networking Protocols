Common Networking Protocols
N10-004, Section 1.1

TCP/IP Protocol Suite
	Similar to the OSI model
	
Application, Transport, Internet, Link layers
	Application Layer
		FTP, BOOTP, TFTP, DNS, HTTP(S), TLS/SSL, VoIP, SSH, POP3, IMAP4, NTP, Telnet, SMTP, SNMP
	Transport Layer
		TCP (Transmission Control Protocol)
			connection-oriented
			reliable delivery
			can manage out of order messages or retransmissions
			correction for lost packets
			loads and unloads the moving truck
				check for out-of-order or missing cargo
		UDP (User Datagram Protocol)
			connectionless
			unreliable
			doesn't care about out-of-order cargo or missing cargo

	Internet Layer
		IPv4
			primary Internet protocol
			32-bit addresses
				4294967296 (2**32 addresses)
			dot-decimal notation
				192.168.3.1
			IP is the moving truck of the Internet (doesn't care about what's in the back)
		IPv6
			128-bit addresses
				improves routing, security, efficiency, and more
			addresses shown as eight groups of four hex digits

		ICMP
			Sends management messages between systems
				Echo Request, Echo Reply
				Destination Unreachable

		IGMP (Internet Group Management Protocol)
			manages membership of multicast groups
			improves efficiency and bandwidth usage
			Protocol Independent Multicast (PIM)
			IGMP subscription is sent to LAN switch, Local Multicast Router, Router(s), Server
			Sends data to multiple devices simultaneously

	Link Layer
		ARP
			IP address to MAC address resolution and vice versa
