## EIGRP
Enhanced Interior Gateway Routing Protocol

- An interior gateway protocol
- A proprietary Cisco protocol
  - does not interoperate with other routers
- EIGRP metrics
  - Total Decay
  - Minimum bandwidth
  - load
  - delay
  - reliability
  - MTU
  - hop count
- Hybrid routing protocol
  - A little link state, a little distance-vector
  - Supports multiple protocols (IP, IPX, AppleTalk)
- Cleanly manage topology changes
  - Speed of convergence is always a significant concern
  - loop free operation
  - Diffusing Update Algorithm (DUAL) chooses best path
- Efficient with bandwidth usage
  - Uses Reliable Transport Protocol (RTP) to communicate with routers

## OSPF
Open shortest Path First

- an interior gateway protocol
- link-state protocol
  - routing is based on connectivity
  - each link has a "cost"
  - Throughput, reliabilty, round-trip
  - Low cost and fastest path wins, identical costs are load balanced
- Dynamic routing protocol
  - Detects changes in network link state and modifies the routing structure very quickly
- OSPF routers and links are grouped logically into areas
  - Default area is 0
  - Each area has its own database of link states
  - flexible
- Very complex protocol
  - common in large enterprise environments
- Very capable protocol

## RIP
Routing Information Protocol

- RIP, RIPv2, RIPng
  - been around since 1988
- Interior gateway protocol
- Distance-vector protocol
- Dynamic routing protocol

### RIPv2
- updated for CIDR
- includes authentication to verify the source
- Network address, number of hops, destination
  - Maximum number of hops is 15
- One of the most popular routing protocols

# Link State, Distance Vector, and Hybrid Routing Protocols
## Link state routing protocols
- Information passed between routers is related to the current connectivity
- consider the speed of the link
- very scalable
  - used most often in large networks
- OSPF, IS-IS

## Distance-vector routing protocols
- Information passed between routers containts routing tables
  - How many "hops" away is anoter network
- Usually automatic, very little configuration
- Good for smaller networks
- RIP, RIPv2, BGP

## Hybrid routing protocol
- Not many examples of this
- see EIGRP
