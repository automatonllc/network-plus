## EIGRP
Enhanced Interior Gateway Routing Protocol

- An interior gateway protocol
- A proprietary Cisco protocol
  - does not interoperate with other routers
- EIGRP metrics
  - Total Decay
  - Minimum bandwidth
  - load
  - delay
  - reliability
  - MTU
  - hop count
- Hybrid routing protocol
  - A little link state, a little distance-vector
  - Supports multiple protocols (IP, IPX, AppleTalk)
- Cleanly manage topology changes
  - Speed of convergence is always a significant concern
  - loop free operation
  - Diffusing Update Algorithm (DUAL) chooses best path
- Efficient with bandwidth usage
  - Uses Reliable Transport Protocol (RTP) to communicate with routers

## OSPF
Open shortest Path First

- an interior gateway protocol
- link-state protocol
  - routing is based on connectivity
  - each link has a "cost"
  - Throughput, reliabilty, round-trip
  - Low cost and fastest path wins, identical costs are load balanced
- Dynamic routing protocol
  - Detects changes in network link state and modifies the routing structure very quickly
- OSPF routers and links are grouped logically into areas
  - Default area is 0
  - Each area has its own database of link states
  - flexible
- Very complex protocol
  - common in large enterprise environments
- Very capable protocol

## RIP
Routing Information Protocol

- RIP, RIPv2, RIPng
  - been around since 1988
- Interior gateway protocol
- Distance-vector protocol
- Dynamic routing protocol

### RIPv2
- updated for CIDR
- includes authentication to verify the source
- Network address, number of hops, destination
  - Maximum number of hops is 15
- One of the most popular routing protocols

# Link State, Distance Vector, and Hybrid Routing Protocols
## Link state routing protocols
- Information passed between routers is related to the current connectivity
- consider the speed of the link
- very scalable
  - used most often in large networks
- OSPF, IS-IS

## Distance-vector routing protocols
- Information passed between routers containts routing tables
  - How many "hops" away is anoter network
- Usually automatic, very little configuration
- Good for smaller networks
- RIP, RIPv2, BGP

## Hybrid routing protocol
- Not many examples of this
- see EIGRP

# Static and Dynamic Routing
## Dynamic routing protocols
- routing protocols make decisions on their own
- all automatic
- minimal configuration on the router
- convergence is handled automatically by the routing protocol
  - the time to convergence is based on the protocol

## Static routing
- the human configures the routes manually
- can be simple or complex, depending on architecture
- very common, even in large environments
  - simple to configure
  - complete control

e.g. for Internet traffic (0.0.0.0/0), send all traffic out port 1 to the next hop of 10.1.1.1

# Routing metrics
Which route should you take? Routing metrics can help you decide.

Different routing protocols use different metrics
- and different algorithms
- RIP uses hopcounts
- EIGRP uses a metric between 0 and 2**32
- Windows uses a metric between 0 and 9999

## Common routing metrics
- Hopcount
- Speed of the network
- Throughput
- Load
- Link utilization
- MTU
- Path reliability
- Packet loss
- Latency

smaller metric numbers are usually better routes

# Next Hop
the destination address of the next gateway

The router doesn't need to know how to get all the way to the destination, just the address of the next router down the line

"Time to live" in IPv4, "hop limit" in IPv6 avoid a packet looping forever

## Configuration
Every router needs to know where its traffic should be sent. Automatically set with dynamic routing, configured manually with static routing.

# Spanning Tree Protocol (STP)
There is no "counting" mechanism at the MAC layer

This is an easy way to bring down a network. It is difficult to troubleshoot, but relatively easy to resolve.

IEEE Standard 802.1D to revent loops in bridged (switched) networks (1990)
- Created by Radia Perlman
- Very common

Bridges are always talking to each other
- Uses MAC-layer multicasts (01:80:C2:00:00:00)
- Bridge Protocl Data Unit (BPDU)
- Default "hello" interval is 2 seconds
- If three "hellos" are missed, the link is considered down

Bridges have three possible ports: Root port, Designated port, and Blocked path

# VLAN (virtual LAN) management
- Logically separate your switch ports into subnets
  - VLANs cannot communicate to each other without a router
- The router/firewall becomes the gatekeeper
- Group users together by function
  - Be careful not to separate users too far from their resources
- Is often integrated with the NAC
  - Move people based on credentials
- Multiple VLANs can share the same network wire (a trunk)
