# 1.3 IP Addressing

## Binary Math
	Bit - represents a 0 or 1
	Byte - a group of 8 bits
		often called an "octet" to avoid ambiguity

## IP Classes, Subnetting
	IP Address, e.g., 192.168.1.165
		everyone needs a unique IP address
	Subnet mask, e.g., 255.255.255.0
		used by the local workstation to determine which subnet it's on
	Default gateway
		allows you to communicate outside of your local subnet
		the default gateway must be an IP address on the local subnet

	The IP address isn't really a single address
	An IP address is a combination of a network ID and a host ID
		the subnet mask determines what part of the IP address is the network and which part is the host

	Classful subnetting
		very specific subnetting architecture
		not used since 1993

		Class A
			1-126
		Class B
			128-191
		Class C
			192-223
			total of 2,097,152 networks, each with 254 hosts
		Class D (multicast)
			224-239
		Class E (reserved)
			240-254

		RFC 1918
			10.0.0.0 - 10.255.255.255
			172.16.0.0 - 172.31.255.255
			192.168.0.0 - 1912.168.255.255

	CIDR (Classless Inter-Domain Routing)
		Created around 1993
		Removed restrictions created by classful subnet masks
		"Cider" block notation
			e.g. 192.168.1.1/24
			indicates how many bits are desdicated to the subnet mask

## IPv4 and IPv6
Two types of addressing, incorporating 32 and 128-bit addresses, respectively
### IPv4

### IPv6
- Groups of zeros can be abbreviated with a double colon ::
	- only one of these abbreviations allowed per address
- Leading zeros are optional, removed from address
- fe80:0000:0000:0000:cabc:c800:00a7:08d5 -> fe80::cabc:c800:a7:8d5
- Your DNS will become very important

## MAC Address Formats
Media Access Control
- OSI Layer 2 address
- Physical address of the network adapter card
	- Each network card has its own, unique MAC address
	- Manufacturers use schemes to avoid duplicating MAC addresses
Extended Unique Identifier
- EUI-48, EUI-64
- MAC is usually a hardware address, EUI is other devices and software
- look identical
- EUI-64 is used in IPv6 and Firewire
MAC addresses can be locally assigned, but not usually

### EUI-48
- Traditional Ethernet MAC address
- Six bytes, usually represented in hexadecimal
- First three bytes are assigned by the IEEE to the manufacturer
	- OUI - organizationally Unique Identifier
- Last three bytes are usually assigned sequentially
	- Duplications are rare

### EUI-64
- Used in newer technologies
	- Firewire
	- IPv6 link-local auto configuration
- Eight bytes, usually represented in hexadecimal
- First three bytes are assigned by the IEEE to the manufacturer
- Last five bytes are usually assigned sequentially
