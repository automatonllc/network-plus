# 1.3 IP Addressing

## Binary Math
- Bit - represents a 0 or 1
- Byte - a group of 8 bits
  - often called an "octet" to avoid ambiguity

## IP Classes, Subnetting
- IP Address, e.g., 192.168.1.165
  - everyone needs a unique IP address
- Subnet mask, e.g., 255.255.255.0
  - used by the local workstation to determine which subnet it's on
- Default gateway
  - allows you to communicate outside of your local subnet
  - the default gateway must be an IP address on the local subnet

**The IP address isn't really a single address**

An IP address is a combination of a network ID and a host ID. The subnet mask determines what part of the IP address is the network and which part is the host.

### Classful subnetting
- very specific subnetting architecture
- not used since 1993

#### Classes
- Class A
  - 1-126
- Class B
  - 128-191
- Class C
  - 192-223
  - total of 2,097,152 networks, each with 254 hosts
- Class D (multicast)
  - 224-239
- Class E (reserved)
  - 240-254

#### RFC 1918
  - 10.0.0.0 - 10.255.255.255
  - 172.16.0.0 - 172.31.255.255
  - 192.168.0.0 - 1912.168.255.255

#### CIDR (Classless Inter-Domain Routing)
  - Created around 1993
  - Removed restrictions created by classful subnet masks
  - "Cider" block notation
    - e.g. 192.168.1.1/24
    - indicates how many bits are desdicated to the subnet mask

## IPv4 and IPv6
Two types of addressing, incorporating 32 and 128-bit addresses, respectively
### IPv4

### IPv6
- Groups of zeros can be abbreviated with a double colon ::
  - only one of these abbreviations allowed per address
- Leading zeros are optional, removed from address
- fe80:0000:0000:0000:cabc:c800:00a7:08d5 -> fe80::cabc:c800:a7:8d5
- Your DNS will become very important

## MAC Address Formats
- Media Access Control
  - OSI Layer 2 address
  - Physical address of the network adapter card
    - Each network card has its own, unique MAC address
    - Manufacturers use schemes to avoid duplicating MAC addresses
- Extended Unique Identifier
  - EUI-48, EUI-64
  - MAC is usually a hardware address, EUI is other devices and software
  - look identical
  - EUI-64 is used in IPv6 and Firewire
- MAC addresses can be locally assigned, but not usually

### EUI-48
- Traditional Ethernet MAC address
- Six bytes, usually represented in hexadecimal
- First three bytes are assigned by the IEEE to the manufacturer
  - OUI - organizationally Unique Identifier
- Last three bytes are usually assigned sequentially
  - Duplications are rare

### EUI-64
- Used in newer technologies
  - Firewire
  - IPv6 link-local auto configuration
- Eight bytes, usually represented in hexadecimal
- First three bytes are assigned by the IEEE to the manufacturer
- Last five bytes are usually assigned sequentially

## Subnetting
### Using the subnet mask

    192.168.1.0     11000000.10101000.00000001.00000000
    255.255.255.0   11111111.11111111.11111111.00000000
                    nnnnnnnn.nnnnnnnn.nnnnnnnn.hhhhhhhh

- The network address is "masked" by the ones
- The client addresses are not masked by the ones
  - Eight bits (00000000) means 254 possible clients
  - Number of possible clients, minus 2 (subnet address, broadcast address)

### The subnet and broadcast addresses
- Your IP address: 192.168.1.165
- Subnet mask: 255.255.255.0
- Subnet address: 192.168.1.0
- Broadcast address: 192.168.1.255
- Number of hosts on this network: 254 (256-2)
- Host address range: 192.168.1.1-192.168.1.254

IP address (bitwise AND) Subnet mask = Subnet address

### Subnetting in the enterprise network
- The ISP assigns an address (or group of addresses)
- You must decide how to subnet the network
  - How many networks do you have?
  - How many hosts do you have?
- By changing subnet mask, you can further divide an IP address into network/host schemes
- Example: subnet mask 255.255.255.192
  - subnet (last octet): 192
  - hosts (last octet): 0-63

## Unicast, Multicast, and Broadcast
### Unicast
- 2 devices
- private information
- only intended for 2 devices
- does not scale well for streaming media

### Multicast
- Delivery of information to interested systems
  - one-to-many
  - systems subscribe to receive information
- Multimedia delivery, stock exchange
- Very specialized
  - Difficult to scale across large networks
  - Generally not much multicast on the internet, even live streams are generally unicast


### Broadcast
- Sends information to everyone on the broadcast domain at once
- One packet, one frame, received by everyone
- Limited scope: limited to "broadcast domain", generally local subnet
- Routing updates, ARP requests

## Automatic Private IP Addressing (APIPA)
Creates a link-local address. It can be used on the local subnet but it will not be sent to another subnet.

- IETF has reserved 169.254.10 through 169.254.254.255
  - Those last 256 addresses are reserved
- Automatically assigned
  - Uses ARP to confirm that the address isn't currently in use
