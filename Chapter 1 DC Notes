Chapter 1 - Network Technologies


1.1 - OSI and IP Models


OSI (Open Systems Interconnection Reference Model)

Layer 7 - Application
Layer 6 - Presentation
Layer 5 - Session
Layer 4 - Transport
Layer 3 - Network
Layer 2 - Data Link
Layer 1 - Physical

(All people seem to need data processing pneumonic)

Layer 1 - Physical Layer
Signals, cables, connectors. This layer does not include protocols. Includes network cards. 

Layer 2 - Data Link
The foundation of network communication. Uses Data Link Control (DLC) protocols using MAC (Media Access Control) address on Ethernet.

Also is the switching layer. Has a table full of MAC addresses. When a packet arrives, looks up MAC of IP address.

Layer 3 - Network
The routing layer. Uses Internet Protocol (IP). Fragments frames to traverse different networks. 

IP Fragmentation - 

DLC HEADER
IP HEADER
TCP HEADER (20 bytes)
TCP Data (24 bytes)

becomes three packets. Each have DLC header, IP header, and attached fragments.
 
Fragments are always in multiples of 8 because of the number of fragmentation offset bits in the IP header 

Layer 4 - Transport
“Post-office layer.” Includes TCP (Transmission Control Protocol) and UDP (User Datagram Protocol). 

Layer 5 - Session
Communication management between devices (start, stop, restart). Half-duplex, full-duplex communication..

Includes control protocols and tunneling protocols. Tears down.

Layer 6 - Presentation
Character encoding, encryption/decryption. Often combined with the Application Layer.

Layer 7 - Application
The layer we see. HTTP, FTP, DNS, POP3. 

1.1 TCP/IP Protocol Suite (IP Suite, or IP model)

Similar to OSI model

Application
Transport
Internet 
Link

1.2 OSI Model In Real Life 


Layer 7 - Application - Your eyes (browser, mail.google.com)
Layer 6 - Presentation - Application Encryption (SSL/TLS)
Layer 5 - Session - Control protocols, tunneling protocols (link the presentation to the transport)
Layer 4 - Transport - TCP segment, UDP datagram (TCP encapsulation)
Layer 3 - Network - IP address, router, packet (IP encapsulation)
Layer 2 - Data Link - Frame, MAC address, Extended Unique Identifier (EUI-48, EUI-64), Switch (ethernet)
Layer 1 - Physical - Cable, NICs, hubs (repeaters, electrical signals)

EUI - 48 and 68 bit formats of physical address. 

Layers 5 - 7 are often bundled in encryption.
1.3 Binary Math

A bit - will be a 0 or a 1. 

A byte - eight bits. Also called an “octet.” Different OS can have different byte sizes. 

Conversion Chart - 

128	64	32	16	8	4	2	1
0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

0-255 possible numbers in 8-bit bytes. 

Move from left to right when adding up to numbers. Less than or equal to (rule). Better 

2 bit

0 1 2 3 adding to 11 

2 ^ bit length = number of possible values


IP Classes 

Every device needs a unique IP address

Ex: 192.168.2.11

Subnet is used by the workstation to determine where to hop to other subnets. Masks IP beyond it.

Ex: 255.255.255.0

Default Gateway - 
The router that allows communication from beyond subnet. Default gateway must be IP address on local subnet.

Ex: 192.168.2.1

IP address isn’t really a single address. A combo of network ID and a host ID. Subnet mask determines what part of the IP address is the network and which part is the host.

Subnet architecture hasnt been used since 1993, but still in casual conversation

Class A - 255.0.0.0 0xxx leading bits
1-126 address, size of network number bit field is 8, 24 remaining bits, 128 networks, 16,777,214 hosts.

Class B - 255.255.0.0 10xx leading bits
128-191 address, size of network number bit field 16, size of remaining 16, 16384 number of networks, 65534 hosts, 255.255.0.0

Class C - 255.255.255.0 110x leading bits
192-223 address, size of network number bit field 24, size of remaining, 8, 27097152 networks, 254 hosts, 255.

Class D (multicast)- 1110 leading bits
224-239 

Class E (reserved) - 1111 leading bits

RFC 1918 changes public vs private addresses

10.0.0.0 - 10.255.255.255 - 16777216 number of adresses, single class A, 10.0.0.0/8 (255.0.0.0) largest CIDR block, host id size 24

172.16.0.0-172.31.255.255 - 1048576 number of addresses, 16 contiguous class B, 172.16.0.0/12(255.240.0.0), host id size 20 bits

192.168.0.0 - 192.168.255.255 - 65536 number of adresses, 256 contiguous class C, 192.168.0.0/16 (255.255.0.0), 16 bits 

Classless Interdomain Routing (CIDR)

Created around 1993
Removed restrictions created by classful subnet masks
“Cider” block notation
192.168.1.1/24 - / means the number of bits used for the subnet. This is the cider block notation

This means subnet mask of 255.255.255.0. 

192.168.1.0 - 192.168.1.255 (254 hosts per subnet)

10.1.0.1/16 
Has a subnet mask of 255.255.0.0

10.1.0.0 - 10.1.255.255 (65534 hosts)

10.1.0.1/26 
Has a subnet mask of 255.255.255.192

10.1.0.0 through 10.1.0.63 (62 addresses per subnet)
